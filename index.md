# RunLore Knowledge Catalog

This directory is an [OKF](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) bundle: a tree
of markdown files with YAML frontmatter. RunLore **reads** it (cached + indexed) to ground
investigations, and **writes** new entries to it (via reviewed PR) as it learns.

Reserved files: `index.md` (this listing) and `log.md` (chronological change history). Every other
`.md` is a concept document. Links between entries assert relationships; the relationship kind is
conveyed by the surrounding prose.

## Playbooks

- [HelmRelease upgrade/install failure](helmrelease-upgrade-failure.md)
- [Flux Kustomization reconciliation failure](kustomization-reconciliation-failure.md)
- [Karpenter EC2NodeClass not ready — AMI alias not found](karpenter-ec2nodeclass-ami-not-found.md)
- [HelmRelease stuck terminal-failed — exhausted retries after a transient install timeout](helmrelease-terminal-failed-exhausted-retries.md)
- [Flux bootstrap — Kustomizations DependencyNotReady until ArtifactGenerator artifacts exist](flux-bootstrap-externalartifact-dependency-cascade.md)

## Incidents

_Learned entries land here as the agent investigates novel, human-sharpened incidents._
- [Harbor Registry Down due to IAM Access Key Quota Limit](harbor-registry-down-due-to-iam-access-key-quota-limit.md) — the Crossplane `AccessKey/xplane-harbor` hit the AWS IAM `AccessKeysPerUser: 2` quota, so the `xplane-harbor-access-key` Secret stays empty and `harbor-registry` fails with `CreateContainerConfigError`.
- [Harbor HelmRelease stuck InstallFailed after a cluster capacity shortage](harbor-helmrelease-terminal-failed.md) — the Harbor install timed out with no schedulable capacity and Flux exhausted its retries; cleared with `helm uninstall` + `flux reconcile --reset`.
- [Application/airflow Degraded — ExternalSecret wrong AWS SM path in dev](application-airflow-degraded.md) — the base `ExternalSecret` referenced a prod-only AWS Secrets Manager key absent in the dev account; fixed with a dev-overlay kustomize patch.
- [RunloreHistoryValidation — synthetic validation alert, no real incident (namespace/workload do not exist)](incidents/runlorehistoryvalidation-synthetic-validation-alert-no-real-incident-namespace-workload-do-not-exist-d383a759.md) — This is a synthetic validation test alert, not a real incident. The alert's own message states it exists only to validate RunLore's recurrence/prior-knowledge notification feature end-to-end, and that the namespace runlore-validation and workload history-check do not exist on the cluster. Independent cluster evidence fully confirms this.
- [Kustomization broken-kustomization ArtifactFailed — non-existent spec.path (this-path-does-not-exist)](incidents/kustomization-broken-kustomization-artifactfailed-non-existent-spec-path-this-path-does-not-exist-2c419b4f.md) — The Kustomization's spec.path is set to 'this-path-does-not-exist', a directory that does not exist in the podinfo Git repository. The kustomize-controller successfully fetches the GitRepository artifact (source is Ready=True) but fails when trying to stat the build path, producing the persistent error: 'kustomization path not found: stat /tmp/kustomization-.../this-path-does-not-exist: no such file or directory'. The alert's 'Source artifact not found, retrying in 10s' message is a transient message logged at 15:07:03 before the GitRepository had stored its artifact; by 15:07:04 the artifact was stored and the real, persistent failure became the non-existent path.
