# RunLore Knowledge Catalog

This directory is an [OKF](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) bundle: a tree
of markdown files with YAML frontmatter. RunLore **reads** it (cached + indexed) to ground
investigations, and **writes** new entries to it (via reviewed PR) as it learns.

Reserved files: `index.md` (this listing) and `log.md` (chronological change history). Every other
`.md` is a concept document. Links between entries assert relationships; the relationship kind is
conveyed by the surrounding prose.

## Playbooks

- [HelmRelease upgrade/install failure](helmrelease-upgrade-failure.md)
- [Flux Kustomization reconciliation failure](kustomization-reconciliation-failure.md)
- [Karpenter EC2NodeClass not ready — AMI alias not found](karpenter-ec2nodeclass-ami-not-found.md)
- [HelmRelease stuck terminal-failed — exhausted retries after a transient install timeout](helmrelease-terminal-failed-exhausted-retries.md)

## Incidents

_Learned entries land here as the agent investigates novel, human-sharpened incidents._
